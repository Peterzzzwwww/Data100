In contemporary society, the development of data science has been closely connected with our daily life. Among Blumenstock’s statement, he pointed out a kind of data-analyzing tool and discussed about its theory and the prospective of development. 

Blumenstock mentioned that through the tracking of  ‘digital signature’, people could be able to track the path of the digital footprints and make it more efficient to allocate resources. However, this kind of data tracking may also have its drawback because these data may be biased because generally the utilizing of data is easier for the richer people comparing with the poor, this would even expand the gap of wealth between classes. 

Blumenstock also mentions the potential solutions such as people could make the utilize of data more structured and more customized learning algorithm would be used. This kind of solution may not radically altered the utilizing of digital signature, but in generally, this would help to create a humbler data science. 

Under the influence of COVID-19, the improvement of digital signature have become increasingly important, as this could help us to closely track the spreading of virus and make our allocation of anti-epidemic resource more effective.# Project2

In contemporary society, we would notice that the effect of big data have permeated to various aspects of hour life. It is an interesting phenomenon that once we search something via google, corresponding advertisements would appear on our computer immediately. 

This have led us to notice that through the development of big data, people could easily achieve things that were even unimaginable in the past. The huge improvement of efficiency brought by big data would obviously accelerate the study of science, social science and humanity. Data science would more likely to work as an assistant that would greatly reduce the participant of human beings. Its influence is so tremendous that people have never experienced before, so it would led to a very interesting question that are we ready to face such a big revolution? As in the past, the revolution of rice may happened step by step, but in contemporary society we could not even imagine what will happen after 10 years. This would certainly make people become worried to some extent. In order to make human being become self-confident and better at mastering Big Data, the subject of Data Science is created. It helps us to have a more comprehensive understand of the world and link the whole world together as it provided us a God’s perspective to ‘see’ all the things happen.
