In contemporary society, the development of data science has been closely connected with our daily life. Among Blumenstock’s statement, he pointed out a kind of data-analyzing tool and discussed about its theory and the prospective of development. 

Blumenstock mentioned that through the tracking of  ‘digital signature’, people could be able to track the path of the digital footprints and make it more efficient to allocate resources. However, this kind of data tracking may also have its drawback because these data may be biased because generally the utilizing of data is easier for the richer people comparing with the poor, this would even expand the gap of wealth between classes. 

Blumenstock also mentions the potential solutions such as people could make the utilize of data more structured and more customized learning algorithm would be used. This kind of solution may not radically altered the utilizing of digital signature, but in generally, this would help to create a humbler data science. 

Under the influence of COVID-19, the improvement of digital signature have become increasingly important, as this could help us to closely track the spreading of virus and make our allocation of anti-epidemic resource more effective.
